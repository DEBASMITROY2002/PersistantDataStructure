Conclusion:

We can see that GoogleBenchmark Tool has performed a huge number of 
iteration on the Linked List.

It created different Randomized Linkedlists with length of 1, 2,4,8,16,64, 128,256. It re-iterated each process more than million times.

Then, it concluded the average time complexity(amortized):
O(n) for each iteation[practically, 122.16 N, here N is the current length of the LL] .

It also created a plot (Time Taken vs N).
And, the curve is linear ( O(n) ).
