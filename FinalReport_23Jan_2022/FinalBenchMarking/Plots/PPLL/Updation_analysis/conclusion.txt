Conclusion:

We can see that GoogleBenchmark Tool has performed a huge number of 
iteration on the Linked List.

It created different Randomized Linkedlists with length of 2000. 
Then, It performed "update operation" at randomized positions(upto 1024 randomized places, per
linked list).
It reiterated the same process process for milions of times.

Then, it concluded the average time complexity(amortized):
O(M) for M updates on a particular linked-list
[practically, 33.36 N, here M is the Number of Random Updates).

Note: Here we have excluded the time to reach the node beofre Updation ( NOt Relevant).

So, per updation it takes: O(1) average time.

It also created a plot (Time Taken vs M).
And, the curve is almost linear ( O(M) ).
