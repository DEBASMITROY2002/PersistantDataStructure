So, we can conclude that "increasing number of mods per node structure", hence, creating fat nodes, is not very effecent. According to many studies, the #mods per nodes is kept within (2*inDegree) in 
partial persistent DS. 

From the 4 plots we can observe that (#mods per node = 3) gives the best results in terms of Auxilary Memory Consumtion.

So, we keep maxModCount = 2 or 3.
